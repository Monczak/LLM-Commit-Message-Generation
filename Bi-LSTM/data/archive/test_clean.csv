0,"Align expectations of various <iden> configurations  <enter> They all want to create an <iden> and when that happens user sees no MBeans, or sometimes just one set (<iden> Core, <iden> or <iden>).

0,Fix mapping of <iden>'s idle-timeout and heartbeat-interval  <enter> Previous to this commit the connection idle timeout and heartbeat interval were mapped to seconds whereas <iden> expects ms for all duration types. <enter> This commit fixes the mapping and removes the default duration unit since it should be considered ms like every other duration properties. <enter>  Closes <link>

3,Extract iterable and array behavior from  <method_name>  
2,Fix a race in  <method_name>  ( <link> )  <enter> We were assuming on a client failure the server wouldn't have any further events. But it will get a failure if we give it a moment. This was causing some test flakiness.

0,Fixup  <file_name>  so that it's worthy of production use.  <enter> This changes the default from the insecure 1024-bit <iden> to a secure 256-bit <iden> key. It adds a new option to use <iden> keys for interoperating with older clients.

0,"Introduce defined extension point for modifying the environment  <enter> The commit introduces a new extension point,  <file_name> , that can be implemented by classes that want to modify the environment. Implementations of  <file_name>  are loaded via  <file_name>  and called in response to the <iden>. <iden> listeners that wish to work with the post-processed environment can continue to listen to <iden> and order themselves to run after  <method_name>  <enter> Existing ApplicationListeners that modify the environment have, where possible, been updated to implement  <file_name>  instead. <enter>  Closes <link> "

0,"Remove duplicate resources from classpath  <enter> We had been making a special case for logback.xml anyway, so extending that to simply deleting recursively all of src/main/resources (or equivalent) from target/classes (or equivalent) seems like it's perfectly justifiable. <enter>  Fixes <link> "

0," <file_name>  API sketch.  <enter> <iden>'m unhappy with java.io:  * No timeouts.  * Every layer needs to copy bytes around. Always copying bytes.  * Features like mark/reset and available() are clumsy.  * Its awkard in mixed text/binary protocols like <iden> because  character decoding is separate and takes over the stream. <enter> Unfortunately java.nio isn't better, just different:  * It's complex.  * <iden> are fixed size.  * No built-in buffer pooling.  * Features like mark/reset/position are clumsy. <enter> This is an obnoxious attempt at a 3rd <iden>/O interface, mostly inspired by <iden> and <iden>, but using growable buffers instead of byte arrays as the core data container.

Prior to this commit the SESSIONS.ser file would either be written to `/tmp` or into `<iden>` (if one was set). <enter> By not saving session data we align <iden> with the other embedded servlet containers and reduce the risk of sensitive information being left in `/tmp`. <enter>  Fixes <link> 
3,"Expose internal APIs for pluggable file systems.  <enter> We aren't yet ready to make <iden> a public type, but I don't mind making it _almost_ available via an internal API for those brave enough to try that. <enter> Also migrate all of our tests to use the  <method_name>  It's simpler. <enter>  <link> "

3,move examples  <enter> <url> 
0,Set <iden> in default <iden>  <enter> Only affects the default <iden> (so when users are not overriding the default global user details). Makes the <iden> effectively available as it would be if we used <iden>.inMemoryAuthentication() as a shared object in the <iden>. <enter>  Fixes <link> 
0,Log warning on slow host resolution  <enter> Update ` <file_name> ` so that if the `<iden>` call takes more than 200ms a warning is logged. <enter>  Closes <link> 
3, <file_name>  parsing.  <enter> This includes everything but character encoding. The implementation is built around one oversized method that runs top to bottom; I found this was easier to follow than the switch statement recommended by the <iden> standard.
